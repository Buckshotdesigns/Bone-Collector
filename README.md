### Description

- You will be given a random number at the start of the game
- There are four skeletons below. By clicking on a skeleton you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
- You win the game by matching your total score to the random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.
- The value of each skeleton is hidden from you until you click on it.
- Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of the skeletons.
- The idea is to due some quick math to figure out the hidden values of the skeletons adding them together to reach a random target number

Its fun and a simple way to keep your brain sharp!
