# unit-4-game

The game reads as follows:

You will be given a random number at the start of the game

There are four skeletons below. By clicking on a skeleton you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

You win the game by matching your total score to the random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

The value of each skeleton is hidden from you until you click on it.


Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of the skeletons.

The idea is to due some quick math to figure out the hidden values of the skeletons adding them together to reach a random target number

Its fun and a simple way to keep your brain sharp!
